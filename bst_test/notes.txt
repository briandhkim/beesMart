-the xml files created for saving xml to hdd portion can be found
	inside xml_data folder which is inside the server folder
-'save_response.xml' was the file created for the purpose of the test;
	'credit_request_test.xml' was just something I made to check my
	curl request xml
-'request.xml' and 'response.xml' were what I received with instructions

-inside main.js the initial large chunk of ajax code is what I had for the 
	test when I finished it on-site
-the code you see below are minor adjustment I made to add promise functionality
	after I finished the on-site assessment. The main functionality did not diverge
	from what has been commented out.
